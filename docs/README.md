# MadChess
UCI Chess Engine

## Status

I have rewritten my C# chess engine, changing its board representation from a "mailbox" array (version 2.x) to bitboards (version 3.0).
Refer to my [MadChess 3.0 Released](https://www.madchess.net/2021/04/19/madchess-3-0-released/) blog post for release details.
Refer to my series of [Version 3.0](https://www.madchess.net/tag/version-3-0/) blog posts for details about the development process.
Download compiled binary executables for Windows from the [Downloads](https://www.madchess.net/downloads/) page.

I use GitHub as a source code repository, not a wiki website.  If you're looking to read source code to understand the very particular
implementation details of chess engine algorithms, you're in the right place.  If you're looking for expository writing about the
concepts behind chess engine algorithms, refer to my [MadChess website](https://www.madchess.net/).
